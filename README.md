<h1>Image Enlarger</h1>

<p>Image Enlarger is a Chrome Extension which enlarges/zooms images on hovering over an image in a webpage.</p>
<p>The extension makes use of the CSS3 Transform Property to enlarge and zoom images when hovered over. Due to the peculiar nature
of the transform property (and CSS itself), images zoom only under certain circumstances and enlarge at other times.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Images that are inline and are contained within an inline parent element will typically have their sizes enlarged
  by a factor of 2. The image will overlay on all other elements on the webpage.</li>
  <li>Images contained within div or an element having a display of 'inline-block' will typically be zoomed within the containing
  parent's dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
I initially set out to make a Image Enlarger (as the name obviously suggests) that enlarged image to twice its dimensions
when hovered over. However, I encountered problems when dealing with images contained within certain parent elements having a 
certain set of CSS properties. Overriding these properties tended to completely destroy the skeleton of the website.<br>
I couldn't find a solution that could preserve the integrity of the website style and structure and at the same time enlarge
all images when hovered over.<br>
So I did what every self respecting developer does and coverted the bug into a feature.<br>
All that said, I'd greatly appreciate it if someone could come up with a feasible solution to this problem.
